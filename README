Introduction:
----------------------
Creates a dynamic image used to display last.fm playcount per 
day/week/month.

<del>This is a quick and really dirty hack that I wrote many years ago. It doesn't
even use a XML parser! It was run on a PHP 4 host, and so, options were limited.

The API call is depreciated as far as I know, and is hence liable to be pulled
by last.fm at any moment.</del>

I've since updated this script with proper XML parsing and utilised the [Last.fm API 2.0](http://www.last.fm/api/intro).

Requirements:
----------------------
Webhosting with PHP 5.
<del>Webhosting with PHP 4/5 with cURL support.</del>
[A Last.fm API key](http://www.last.fm/api/account). (Required by new API)

TODO:
----------------------
<del>Clean up and modernise code to utilise PHP 5 functions and utilise last.fm API 2.0.</del>
